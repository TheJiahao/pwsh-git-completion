# pwsh-git-completion
Simple ad-hoc git completion that works for me

## Why not [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)?

I couldn't figure out how to _only_ get the completion to work, without loading the whole module, so I created my own that doesn't slow down your profile by ~0.5 seconds.

Also, this one tries to intelligently provide completions based on context, e.g. `git add <tab>` will provide a list of unstaged/modified files, while `git switch <tab>` provides a list of branches to switch to, etc. They are added as needed.

## How to use?

Just put the contents of `git-completion.ps1` in your powershell profile, e.g. `notepad.exe $PROFILE`.

It's also recommended to have 
```
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Tab -Function MenuComplete
```
in your Powershell profile to get nice completion ðŸ˜Š

## Requirements

Probably the latest version of [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell), or at least [PSReadLine](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine) 2.1.0.
